Ideally, it would have been better using Page Object Design approach to solve these issues. However due to time. I have a BDD approach using Cucumber with Java.Â  The questions are a bit tricky but good. I need notice that there is no Contact page as mentioned in the text but there is a Contact section.

So could not find a contact page. I have done this using Maven and have added all the jars in the POM.xml.
